#### Run

- npm run dev
- npm run build

#### LESS files are compiled separately
- gulp watch


### Thougths:
At the the beginning I was planning a proper app, after several hours I cut the stuff down, replaced with simple and effective code to stay within requirements/timeframes.

### Notes:
**Did a quick user validation:**
- didn't hide countries to show that there are more opportunities for a user.
- 12 project terms is too much(and there could be more bc they loading from JSON) to handle(the one of the versions was with 'select all' checkbox ), so only two (presumably)popular choices checked.

###Would be nice to add/change
- bold cheapest price
- momentum.js Filters
- loading screen with async data bindings
- country/project filters?
